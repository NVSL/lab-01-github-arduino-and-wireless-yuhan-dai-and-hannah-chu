###Lab1
**TODO**

+ Modify the RFChat code to send data as fast as possible from one board to the other. 
+ Measure the bandwidth and the dropped packet rate 
+ Write up about any difficulties, the methodology, and results from measuring the bandwidth and dropped/lost packet rate

**Related Questions**

1. How will you measure bandwidth with reasonable accuracy?
2. How will you determine whether a packet has been dropped?
3. Do you think you can send data in both directions a quickly? 
4. How do these measurement vary as the boards move farther apart?
